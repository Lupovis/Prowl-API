## <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs please provide a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information to fix bug.

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/Lupovis/Prowl-API/issues).

## <a name="coding-rules"></a>Coding rules

When contributing to this project you should follow these coding patterns.

1. Create variables with clear, easy-to-read name and meaning.
2. Write comments above every function, which clearly mentions what this function is doing.
3. Follow eslint rules and avoid disabling them at all cost. There may be times when disabling is the only option, then write a note when you raise a PR about why you have disabled rules in code.
4. When you write a complex to understand logic write a short comment on what the code is doing and why you have preferred that way.

## <a name="git-rules"></a>Git commit message guidelines

We follow commit conventions on how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history** and track down changes.

We follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) for writing conventional commit message and branch name. Make sure that you follow this pattern when creating new branches and while commiting your changes
